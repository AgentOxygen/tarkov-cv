# Tarkov CV Project
The goal of this project was to develop an app for parsing through twitch livestreams of the video game Escape from Tarkov and log the contents of lootable contianers using image recognition.
Videos were pulled using the Twitch API and OpenCV template matching was used to systematically parse through hundreds of hours of videos and identify in-game items as various streamers play the game.
The app also logs what specific contianer the item was identified in.

## Motivation
The rarity of certain in-game items is unknown and the locations where they may be found most frequently is also unknown. 
This project utilizes image recognition and the thousands of hours of gameplay footage available on Twitch.tv to answer these questions.
