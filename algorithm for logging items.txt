1) Check last frame of previous to first frame of current:
	a) If same number of filled cells in same positions, combine
	b) Run this through entire list to concatenate groups
2) Go through each group
	a) Check and log container type
	b) Get 'A' number of filled cells in the first frame
	c) Check frames until a tag is found
	d) Log tag and position when detected, add to list
	e) Compare tags found in future to this list to prevent duplicates


Idea:
read first letter to narrow search for items
